Python Apple Support
====================

This is a meta-package for building a version of Python that can be embedded
into a macOS, iOS, tvOS or watchOS project.

**This branch builds a packaged version of Python 3.14**.
Other Python versions are available by cloning other branches of the main
repository:

* `Python 3.9 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.9>`__
* `Python 3.10 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.10>`__
* `Python 3.11 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.11>`__
* `Python 3.12 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.12>`__
* `Python 3.13 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.13>`__

It works by downloading, patching, and building a fat binary of Python and
selected pre-requisites, and packaging them as frameworks that can be
incorporated into an XCode project. The binary modules in the Python standard
library are distributed as binaries that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

The macOS package is a re-bundling of the official macOS binary, modified so that
it is relocatable, with the IDLE, Tkinter and turtle packages removed, and the
App Store compliance patch applied.

The iOS, tvOS and watchOS packages compiled by this project use the official
`PEP 730 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/>`__ code that is part of Python 3.13
to provide iOS support; the relevant patches have been backported to 3.9-3.12.
Additional patches have been applied to add tvOS and watchOS support.

The binaries support x86_64 and arm64 for macOS; arm64 for iOS and appleTV
devices; and arm64_32 for watchOS devices. It also supports device simulators on
both x86_64 and M1 hardware. This should enable the code to run on:

* macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, on:
    * MacBook (including MacBooks using Apple Silicon)
    * iMac (including iMacs using Apple Silicon)
    * Mac Mini (including Apple Silicon Mac minis)
    * Mac Studio (all models)
    * Mac Pro (all models)
* iOS 13.0 or later, on:
    * iPhone (6s or later)
    * iPad (5th gen or later)
    * iPad Air (all models)
    * iPad Mini (2 or later)
    * iPad Pro (all models)
    * iPod Touch (7th gen or later)
* tvOS 12.0 or later, on:
    * Apple TV (4th gen or later)
* watchOS 4.0 or later, on:
    * Apple Watch (4th gen or later)

Quickstart
----------

The easist way to use these packages is by creating a project with `Briefcase
<https://github.com/beeware/briefcase>`__. Briefcase will download pre-compiled
versions of these support packages, and add them to an Xcode project (or
pre-build stub application, in the case of macOS).

Pre-built versions of the frameworks can be downloaded from the `Github releases page
<https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/releases>`__ and added to your project.

Alternatively, to build the frameworks on your own, download/clone this
repository, and then in the root directory, and run:

* ``make`` (or ``make all``) to build everything.
* ``make macOS`` to build everything for macOS.
* ``make iOS`` to build everything for iOS.
* ``make tvOS`` to build everything for tvOS.
* ``make watchOS`` to build everything for watchOS.

This should:

1. Download the original source packages
2. Patch them as required for compatibility with the selected OS
3. Build the packages as Xcode-compatible XCFrameworks.

The resulting support packages will be packaged as a ``.tar.gz`` file
in the ``dist`` folder.

Each support package contains:

* ``VERSIONS``, a text file describing the specific versions of code used to build the
  support package;
* ``Python.xcframework``, a multi-architecture build of the Python runtime library

On iOS/tvOS/watchOS, the ``Python.xcframework`` contains a
slice for each supported ABI (device and simulator). The folder containing the
slice can also be used as a ``PYTHONHOME``, as it contains a ``bin``, ``include``
and ``lib`` directory.

The ``bin`` folder does not contain Python executables (as they can't be
invoked). However, it *does* contain shell aliases for the compilers that are
needed to build packages. This is required because Xcode uses the ``xcrun``
alias to dynamically generate the name of binaries, but a lot of C tooling
expects that ``CC`` will not contain spaces.

Each slice of an iOS/tvOS/watchOS XCframework also contains a
``platform-config`` folder with a subfolder for each supported architecture in
that slice. These subfolders can be used to make a macOS Python environment
behave as if it were on an iOS/tvOS/watchOS device. This works in one of two
ways:

1. **A sitecustomize.py script**. If the ``platform-config`` subfolder is on
   your ``PYTHONPATH`` when a Python interpreter is started, a site
   customization will be applied that patches methods in ``sys``, ``sysconfig``
   and ``platform`` that are used to identify the system.

2. **A make_cross_venv.py script**. If you call ``make_cross_venv.py``,
   providing the location of a virtual environment, the script will add some
   files to the ``site-packages`` folder of that environment that will
   automatically apply the same set of patches as the ``sitecustomize.py``
   script whenever the environment is activated, without any need to modify
   ``PYTHONPATH``. If you use ``build`` to create an isolated PEP 517
   environment to build a wheel, these patches will also be applied to the
   isolated build environment that is created.

iOS distributions also contain a copy of the iOS ``testbed`` project - an Xcode
project that can be used to run test suites of Python code. See the `CPython
documentation on testing packages
<https://docs.python.org/3/using/ios.html#testing-a-python-package>`__ for
details on how to use this testbed.

For a detailed instructions on using the support package in your own project,
see the `usage guide <./USAGE.md>`__

Building binary wheels
----------------------

This project packages the Python standard library, but does not address building
binary wheels. Binary wheels for macOS can be obtained from PyPI. `Mobile Forge
<https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge>`__ is a project that provides the
tooling to build build binary wheels for iOS (and potentially for tvOS and
watchOS, although that hasn't been tested).
