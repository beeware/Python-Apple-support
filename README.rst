Python Apple Support
====================

This is a meta-package for building a version of Python that can be embedded
into a macOS, iOS, tvOS or watchOS project.

**This branch builds a packaged version of Python 3.11.5**.
Other Python versions are available by cloning other branches of the main
repository:

* `Python 3.8 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.8>`__
* `Python 3.9 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.9>`__
* `Python 3.10 <https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/tree/3.10>`__

It works by downloading, patching, and building a fat binary of Python and selected
pre-requisites, and packaging them as static libraries that can be incorporated into an
XCode project. The binary modules in the Python standard library are statically
compiled, but are distributed as objects that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

It exposes *almost* all the modules in the Python standard library except for:

* ``dbm.gnu``
* ``tkinter``
* ``readline``
* ``nis`` (Deprecated by PEP594)
* ``ossaudiodev`` (Deprecated by PEP594)
* ``spwd`` (Deprecated by PEP594)

The following standard library modules are available on macOS, but not the other
Apple platforms:

* ``curses``
* ``grp``
* ``multiprocessing``
* ``posixshmem``
* ``posixsubprocess``
* ``syslog``

The binaries support x86_64 and arm64 for macOS; arm64 for iOS and appleTV
devices; and arm64_32 for watchOS. It also supports device simulators on both
x86_64 and M1 hardware. This should enable the code to run on:

* macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later, on:
    * MacBook (including MacBooks using Apple Silicon)
    * iMac (including iMacs using Apple Silicon)
    * Mac Mini (including M1 Apple Silicon Mac minis)
    * Mac Studio (all models)
    * Mac Pro (all models)
* iOS 12.0 or later, on:
    * iPhone (6s or later)
    * iPad (5th gen or later)
    * iPad Air (all models)
    * iPad Mini (2 or later)
    * iPad Pro (all models)
    * iPod Touch (7th gen or later)
* tvOS 9.0 or later, on Apple TV (4th gen or later)
* watchOS 4.0 or later, on Apple Watch (4th gen or later)

Quickstart
----------

The easist way to use these packages is by creating a project with `Briefcase
<https://github.com/beeware/briefcase>`__. Briefcase will download pre-compiled
versions of these support packages, and add them to an Xcode project (or
pre-build stub application, in the case of macOS).

Pre-built versions of the frameworks can be downloaded from the `Github releases page
<https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/releases>`__ and added to your project.

Alternatively, to build the frameworks on your own, download/clone this
repository, and then in the root directory, and run:

* ``make`` (or ``make all``) to build everything.
* ``make macOS`` to build everything for macOS.
* ``make iOS`` to build everything for iOS.
* ``make tvOS`` to build everything for tvOS.
* ``make watchOS`` to build everything for watchOS.

This should:

1. Download the original source packages
2. Patch them as required for compatibility with the selected OS
3. Build the packages as Xcode-compatible XCFrameworks.

The resulting support packages will be packaged as a ``.tar.gz`` file
in the ``dist`` folder.

Each support package contains:

* ``VERSIONS``, a text file describing the specific versions of code used to
  build the support package;
* ``Python.xcframework``, a multi-architecture build of the Python runtime library
* ``python-stdlib``, the code and binary modules comprising the Python standard
  library. On iOS, tvOS and watchOS, there are 2 copies of every binary module -
  one for physical devices, and one for the simulator. The simulator binaries
  are "fat", containing code for both x86_64 and arm64.

Non-macOS platforms also contain a ``platform-site`` folder. This contains a
site customization script that can be used to make your local Python install
look like it is an on-device install. This is needed because when you run
``pip`` you'll be on a macOS machine; if ``pip`` tries to install a binary
package, it will install a macOS binary wheel (which won't work on
iOS/tvOS/watchOS). However, if you add the ``platform-site`` folder to your
``PYTHONPATH`` when invoking pip, the site customization will make your Python
install return ``platform`` and ``sysconfig`` responses consistent with
on-device behavior, which will cause ``pip`` to install platform-appropriate
packages.

For a detailed instructions on using the support package in your own project,
see the `usage guide <./USAGE.md>`__

Building binary wheels
----------------------

When building binary wheels, you may need to use the libraries built by this
project as inputs (e.g., the `cffi` module uses `libffi`). To support this, this
project is able to package these dependencies as "wheels" that can be added to
the `server/pypi/dist` directory of the `binary dependency builder
project <https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy>`__.

To build these wheels, run:

* ``make wheels`` to make all wheels for all mobile platforms
* ``make wheels-iOS`` to build all the iOS wheels
* ``make wheels-tvOS`` to build all the tvOS wheels
* ``make wheels-watchOS`` to build all the watchOS wheels
